# Foundryvtt Art Gallery

Welcome to Art Gallery. This module allows you to create a small gallery of pictures attached directly to an actor. Great if you have accumulated lots of cool art of your character over the course of a long campaign, or if you just want to have some relevant images "at hand".

## How to use

There are two ways to access the art gallery.

**1)** Right-clicking the actor in the Actor Directory.

![Actor Directory](doc/actor_directory.png) 

**2)** In the header bar of the sheet

![Actorsheet Header](doc/actorsheet_header.png) 

You can then directly add artpieces to the gallery. If you have permission to use the FileBrowser then a button will appear that let's you select a file from within it.

Inside the gallery you can zoom into each picture by clicking on it, which then also allows you to share it with other people

## Future

I have a few more features planned for this module, but they fall squarely into the realm of "when I feel like it"

Possible future features include, but are not limited to:

- Albums
- Permissions per image
- Sharing images to only select people

## Installation

It's always easiest to install modules from the in game add-on browser.

To install this module manually:
1.  Inside the Foundry "Configuration and Setup" screen, click "Add-on Modules"
2.  Click "Install Module"
3.  In the "Manifest URL" field, paste the following url:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p4535992/foundryvtt-art-gallery/master/src/module.json`

4.  Click 'Install' and wait for installation to complete
5.  Don't forget to enable the module in game using the "Manage Module" button

### libWrapper

This module uses the [libWrapper](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper) library for wrapping core methods. It is a hard dependency and it is recommended for the best experience and compatibility with other modules.


## Known Issue

## Features

# Build

## Install all packages

```bash
npm install
```
## npm build scripts

### build

will build the code and copy all necessary assets into the dist folder and make a symlink to install the result into your foundry data; create a
`foundryconfig.json` file with your Foundry Data path.

```json
{
  "dataPath": "~/.local/share/FoundryVTT/"
}
```

`build` will build and set up a symlink between `dist` and your `dataPath`.

```bash
npm run-script build
```

### NOTE:

You don't need to build the `foundryconfig.json` file you can just copy the content of the `dist` folder on the module folder under `modules` of Foundry

### build:watch

`build:watch` will build and watch for changes, rebuilding automatically.

```bash
npm run-script build:watch
```

### clean

`clean` will remove all contents in the dist folder (but keeps the link from build:install).

```bash
npm run-script clean
```
### lint and lintfix

`lint` launch the eslint process based on the configuration [here](./.eslintrc)

```bash
npm run-script lint
```

`lintfix` launch the eslint process with the fix argument

```bash
npm run-script lintfix
```

### prettier-format

`prettier-format` launch the prettier plugin based on the configuration [here](./.prettierrc)

```bash
npm run-script prettier-format
```

### package

`package` generates a zip file containing the contents of the dist folder generated previously with the `build` command. Useful for those who want to manually load the module or want to create their own release

```bash
npm run-script package
```
